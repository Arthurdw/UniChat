## Further configuration

If you would like to further configure the website, you can easily add rooms manually in the `data/rooms.ts` file!
If you would like to change the theme in any way, all the components and settings are set in the `themes/` folder. In the themes folder you can feel edit the color scheme (`themes/colors.ts`) or edit the general looks `themes/properties`.
